The data scientist uses the survey data to conclude that, on average, users spend 15 minutes surfing the company website before moving on to other things. What is wrong with this conclusion?"

That means that there is a 95% chance that the user would not fill out the survey each time they click on the site. If the data scientist's conclusion is dependent on the consumer survey, then it is too small a sample size and does not adequately reflect the consumer's behaviour on the the site. Taking an average of this small sample would give inaccurate representation of the actual surfing patterns of the consumers on the site. "
